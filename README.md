# vinylCore
A metadata schema for amateur collectors of vinyl records.

vinylCore was developed by Fernanda Schaefer, Mariah Schaefer, and Courtney Smith as a final project for the IS 562: Metadata in Theory & Practice class at the iSchool at Illinois. 

This repository contains the schema's XSD file and data dictionary, as well as some sample metadata records.

The XSD file is hosted at the following URL: https://mschafr2.web.illinois.edu/vinylCore.xsd
